# 🏆 LeetCode Practice Arena

Welcome to my **LeetCode Practice Arena**! 🎯 This repo is where I battle algorithms, wrestle with data structures, and level up my problem-solving skills one commit at a time.

## 🚀 About
This repository is my personal collection of solutions to LeetCode problems. Whether it's easy warm-ups, mind-bending hard problems, or everything in between, you'll find my journey through LeetCode right here. My goal is to:
- Solve problems consistently 🏋️‍♂️
- Improve problem-solving speed ⏳
- Master data structures & algorithms 🧠

## 📜 Categories
Problems are categorized by **difficulty** and **topic**, so feel free to explore:
- 🟢 **Easy** – Quick wins and confidence boosters
- 🟡 **Medium** – Where things get spicy 🌶️
- 🔴 **Hard** – Brain-breaking puzzles 🤯
